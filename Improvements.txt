Here's a list of things I think I could've done differently

1. Indexed some fields in the models
    1.1 - Restaurant:
        - uuid
        - city
        - place_id
    1.2 - Receipt
        - uuid
        - date
    1.3 - CustomUser
        - uuid
        - email

2. I could've used the address field also in the Receipt model but for simplicity I just used one field
3. On `serivces.py::populate_restaurant` I could've moved lines 18 and 19 inside the IF condition
4. I could've moved the `get_queryset` method on the `lunch/api/views.py` to the ReceiptMixin class and return the "base" queryset which
would be `Receipt.objects.filter(user=self.request.user)`. I could possibly have created a generic `get_queryset_based_on_user`
(or something along those lines) method that would take a `klass` param and return that queryset mentioned above.
